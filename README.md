## Advent of Code 2018

https://adventofcode.com/2018/

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like."

In this repo I will publish my ways for resolving those problems. I don't know if I will have time for this event or not, but I will try to find it ;)

I'm not uploading inputs, because of their big size.

EDIT 25.12.2018: Officialy gave up. Archiving.
