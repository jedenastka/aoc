## Advent of Code 2018

https://adventofcode.com/2018/

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like."

In this repo I will publish my ways for resolving those problems.

I'm not uploading inputs, because of their big size.
